# Circle Detection ML Challenge:: 

**Goal**

The objective of the Circle Detection ML Challenge is to design a robust circle detector capable of accurately locating circles in images with varying levels of noise. The challenge involves developing a deep learning model that takes an image as input and outputs the circle's center coordinates (x, y) and its radius.

**Project Overview**

Task:

Develop a deep-learning model to detect circles in images. The model should be trained to handle noisy images and provide precise estimates of the circle's parameters.

_Input_


Input images with varying levels of noise.
_Output_

Predicted location of the circle's center (x, y).
The predicted radius of the detected circle.
